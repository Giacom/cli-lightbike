# cli-lightbike
Very old project which badly created a lightbike game for the command prompt. It uses C# .NET and has been badly ported to .NET Core.

# Issues
You must set your terminal to 128x64 in order to play this without graphical glitches. .NET used to let you set it through code but now it doesn't with .NET Core.

The input is very slow in .NET Core. Probably an issue with the new way you have to sleep.
